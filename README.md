Analyzing single cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing public datasets

Single cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing technology gives advanced insights inside the tumour microenvironment at single cell resolution and to see cellular interactions within the tumour microenvironment. The technology has many advanatges such as for detecting genetic variants by analysing the genome, understand epigenetic variation and investigating transcriptome of individual cells in a population. 

Brain cancer is the most common cancer and accounts for arouns 20% of all systematic cancers. It is the leading cause of death in advanced stage cancers. Thus, it is crucial to determine the biomarkers and identify therapeutic targets.

Human Brain Cancer Dataset:-
-Using a human brain cancer dataset from La Manno et al. (2016). 
-Taking the help of the seurat and scanpy Bioconductor R packages to help understand and analyse the data
